  Changes:
    - Initial Release.
    - Fuel value for most chemical solids are doubled to explain boiler effectivity better
    - Don't adjust nuclear fuel, rocket fuel, etc.
    - Boiler efficiency is tiered (percentages relative to current values)
    - all tiers and fuel factors are customizable
    - boiler1: default 50% (actually 100% with doubled fuel value)
    - boiler2: default 55% (actually 110%)
    - boiler3: default 62.5% (actually 125%)
    - boiler4: default 72.5% (actually 145%)
    - boiler5: default 85% (actually 170%)
    - fluid boiler1: default 100%
    - fluid boiler2: default 110%
    - fluid boiler3: default 125%
    - fluid boiler4: default 145%
    - Nuclear efficiencies are unchanged
