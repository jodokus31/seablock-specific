Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2021.08.14
  Changes:
    - Initial Release.
    - Disables most water void recipes. Exceptions: (Regular Water, Purified, Saline, Heavy Mud, Concentrated Mud, Light Mud, Thin Mud)
    - Disables most chemical void recipes. Exceptions: (Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Chlorine, Compressed Air)
    - Spill items on the floor, when containers are getting destroyed
    - Increase mining time of storage tanks and fluid wagons
    - Flarestack consumes 5 times more power
    - Add 2 recipes to get a bit of steam from hydrogen/oxygen (activated from start)
    - One to consume exactly the ratio of dirty electrolysis
    - One to consume more hydron, to be able to balance oxygen consumption.
    - Chemical plant mk1 is available from start.
    - Use "Burner power progression" (seperate mod) to adjust efficiencies of boiler tiers 
    - Fuel value for most chemical solids are doubled
    - Nerfed boiler efficiencies compared to default settings
    - Boiler mk1: 42.5% (actually 85% because of doubled fuel values)
    - Boiler mk2: 50.0% (actually 100%)
    - Boiler mk3: 57.5% (actually 115%)
    - Boiler mk4: 65.0% (actually 130%)
    - Boiler mk5: 75.0% (actually 150%)
    - Fluid boiler mk1: 60.0%
    - Fluid boiler mk2: 70.0%
    - Fluid boiler mk3: 82.5%
    - Fluid boiler mk4: 95.0%
    - Nuclear efficiencies are unchanged
