  "description": "Voiding gases and fluids is very restricted and consumes more energy. Add recipes to use hydrogen/oxygen to get steam.\n\nUse 'Burner Power Progression' (seperate mod) to adjust efficiencies of boiler tiers.\n\nDestroyed containers spill items on the ground instead of destroying them. Mining time for storage tanks and fluid wagon is increased.\n",
