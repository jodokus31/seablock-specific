H2/O2 still can be voided, but also could be tranformed into steam.\nLower tier boilers are less efficient, but higher tiers get better.\nRebalance sorting to encourage multioutput sorting.\n\nCAUTION: Voiding solid item by destroying containers won't work, because the items get spilled on the ground.\n",
